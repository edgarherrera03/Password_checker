# Password_checker
Password checker using an API to the site https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to determine whether a password has been leaked.

To test it, type the following command into your command prompt:

python3 password_checker.py password1 password2 ...

You can test as many passwords as you want at the same time. Special characters may not be recognized, so you need to use \ in front of each.
